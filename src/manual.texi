3D_Viewer is developed in the C/C++ programming language using QT Creator version 6.2.
The program is designed to view 3D models in a wireframe viewer (3D Viewer). Models are loaded from .obj files and can be viewed on the screen with the ability to rotate, scale and move.

@enumerate
@item
Move model:
To move the model, enter the distance in the corresponding'x', 'y' and 'z' fields by which you want to move it. Then click the "Move" button. The changes will be displayed in the visualization area
@item
Rotate modet:
To rotate the model, enter the angles in the corresponding fields in the 'x', 'y' and 'z' axes by which you want to rotate it. Then click the "Rotate" button. The changes will be displayed in the visualization area.
@item
Scale model:
To change the scale of the model, enter its new value in the corresponding fields on the 'x', 'y' and 'z' axes. Then press the 'Scale' button. The changes will be displayed in the visualization area.
